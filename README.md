## Setup Guide
### Baked versions
`backend.ai-webui` production version is also served as `backend.ai-app` and refered by `backend.ai-webserver` as submodule. If you use `backend.ai-webserver`, you are using latest stable release of `backend.ai-webui`.

### Configuration

Backend.AI Web UI uses `config.toml` located in app root directory. You can prepare many `config.toml.[POSTFIX]` in `configs` directory to switch various configurations.

> NOTE: Update only `config.toml.sample` when you update configurations.
> Any files in `configs` directory are auto-created via [`Makefile`](Makefile).

These are options in `config.toml`.
You can refer the role of each key in [`config.toml.sample`](config.toml.sample)


## Debug mode
When enabling debug mode, It will show certain features used for debugging in both web and app respectively.
### Debugging in web browser
   - Show raw error messages
   - Enable creating session with manual image name

### Debugging in app(electron)
ðŸš§ WIP ðŸš§


## Branches

 * main : Development branch
 * release : Latest release branch
 * feature/[feature-branch] : Feature branch. Uses `git flow` development scheme.
 * tags/v[versions] : version tags. Each tag represents release versions.

## Development Guide

Backend.AI Web UI is built with
 * `lit-element` as webcomponent framework
 * `npm` as package manager
 * `rollup` as bundler
 * `electron` as app shell

### Code of conduct

View [Code of conduct](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai-webui/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) for community guidelines.

### Initializing

```console
$ npm i
```

If this is not your first-time compilation, please clean the temporary directories with this command:

```console
$ make clean
```

You must perform first-time compilation for testing. Some additional mandatory packages should be copied to proper location.

```console
$ make compile_wsproxy
```

Some necessary libraries will be copied to `src/lib`. Now you are ready to test.

### Developing / testing without bundling

On a terminal:
```console
$ npm run build:d   # To watch source changes
```
On another terminal:
```console
$ npm run server:d  # To run dev. web server
```
On yet another terminal:
```console
$ npm run wsproxy  # To run websocket proxy
```

### Lint Checking
```console
$ npm run lint  # To check lints
```

### Unit Testing

The project uses `testcafe` as testing framework.
To perform functional tests, you must run complete Backend.AI cluster before starting test.

On a terminal:
```console
$ npm run server:d  # To run dev. web server
```
On another terminal:
```console
$ npm run test      # Run tests (tests are located in `tests` directory)
```

### Electron (app mode) development / testing

#### Live testing

On a terminal:
```console
$ npm run server:d    # To run test server
```
OR
```console
$ npm run server:p    # To run compiled source
```

On another terminal:
```console
$ npm run electron:d  # Run Electron as dev mode.
```

## Serving Guide

### Preparing bundled source

```console
$ make compile
```

Then bundled resource will be prepared in `build/rollup`. Basically, both app and web serving is based on static serving sources in the directory. However, to work as single page application, URL request fallback is needed.

### Serving with nginx

If you need to serve with nginx, please install and setup `backend.ai-wsproxy` package for websocket proxy. Bundled websocket proxy is simplified version for single-user app.

This is nginx server configuration example. [APP PATH] should be changed to your source path.

```nginx
server {
    listen      443 ssl http2;
    listen [::]:443 ssl http2;
    server_name [SERVER URL];
    charset     utf-8;

    client_max_body_size 15M;   # maximum upload size.

    root [APP PATH];
    index index.html;

    location / {
        try_files $uri /index.html;
    }
    keepalive_timeout 120;

    ssl_certificate [CERTIFICATE FILE PATH];
    ssl_certificate_key [CERTIFICATE KEY FILE PATH];
}
```

### Building docker image using docker-compose

Make sure that you compile the Web UI.

e.g. You will download the `backend.ai-webserver` package.

```console
$ make compile
```

#### Backend.AI WebServer
Good for develop phase. Not recommended for production environment.

Note: This command will use Web UI source in `build/rollup` directory. No certificate will be used therefore web server will serve as HTTP.

Copy `webserver.example.conf` in `docker_build` directory into current directory as `webserver.conf` and modify configuration files for your needs.

```console
$ docker-compose build webui-dev  # build only
$ docker-compose up webui-dev     # for testing
$ docker-compose up -d webui-dev  # as a daemon
```

Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8080` to test web server.

#### Backend.AI WebServer with SSL
Recommended for production.

Note: You have to enter the certificates (`chain.pem` and `priv.pem`) into `certificates` directory. Otherwise, you will have an error during container initialization.

Copy `webserver.example.ssl.conf` in `docker_build` directory into current directory as `webserver.conf` and modify configuration files for your needs.

```console
$ docker-compose build webui  # build only
$ docker-compose up webui     # for testing
$ docker-compose up -d webui  # as a daemon
```

Visit `https://127.0.0.1:443` to test web server serving. Change `127.0.0.1` to your production domain.

#### Removing

```console
$ docker-compose down
```

#### Manual image build
```console
$ make compile
$ docker build -t backendai-webui .
```

Testing / Running example

Check your image name is `backendai-webui_webui` or `backendai-webui_webui-ssl`. Otherwise, change the image name in the script below.

```console
$ docker run --name backendai-webui -v $(pwd)/config.toml:/usr/share/nginx/html/config.toml -p 80:80 backendai-webui_webui /bin/bash -c "envsubst '$$NGINX_HOST' < /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.template > /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf && nginx -g 'daemon off;'"
$ docker run --name backendai-webui-ssl -v $(pwd)/config.toml:/usr/share/nginx/html/config.toml -v $(pwd)/certificates:/etc/certificates -p 443:443 backendai-webui_webui-ssl /bin/bash -c "envsubst '$$NGINX_HOST' < /etc/nginx/conf.d/default-ssl.template > /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf && nginx -g 'daemon off;'"
```

### Building / serving with webserver

If you need to serve as webserver (ID/password support) without compiling anything, you can use pre-built code through webserver submodule.

To download and deploy web UI from pre-built source, do the following in `backend.ai` repository:

```console
$ git submodule update --init --checkout --recursive
```


### Running websocket proxy with node.js

This is only needed with pure ES6 dev. environment / browser. Websocket proxy is embedded in Electron and automatically starts.

```console
$ npm run wsproxy
```

If webui app is behind an external http proxy, and you have to pass through
it to connect to a webserver or manager server, you can set
`EXT_HTTP_PROXY` environment variable with the address of the http proxy.
Local websocket proxy then communicates with the final destination via the http
proxy. The address should include the protocol, host, and/or port (if exists).
For example,

```console
$ export EXT_HTTP_PROXY=http://10.20.30.40:3128 (Linux)
$ set EXT_HTTP_PROXY=http://10.20.30.40:3128 (Windows)
```

Even if you are using Electron embedded websocket proxy, you have to set the
environment variable manually to pass through a http proxy.


## Build web server with specific configuration

You can prepare site-specific configuration as `toml` format. Also, you can build site-specific web bundle refering in `configs` directory.

Note: Default setup will build `es6-bundled` version. If you want to use `es6-unbundled`, make sure that your webserver supports HTTP/2 and setup as HTTPS with proper certification.

```console
$ make web site=[SITE CONFIG FILE POSTFIX]
```
If no prefix is given, default configuration file will be used.

Example:

```console
$ make web site=beta
```

You can manually modify config.toml for your need.

## App Building Guide
### Building Electron App

Electron building is automated using `Makefile`.

```console
$ make clean      # clean prebuilt codes
$ make mac        # build macOS app (both Intel/Apple)
$ make mac_intel  # build macOS app (Intel x64)
$ make mac_apple  # build macOS app (Apple Silicon)
$ make win        # build win64 app
$ make linux      # build linux app
$ make all        # build win64/macos/linux app
```

#### Windows x86-64 version

```console
$ make win
```
Note: Building Windows x86-64 on other than Windows requires Wine > 3.0
Note: On macOS Catalina, use scripts/build-windows-app.sh to build Windows 32bitpackage. From macOS 10.15+, wine 32x is not supported.
Note: Now the `make win` command support only Windows x64 app, therefore you do not need to use `build-windows-app.sh` anymore.

#### macOS version
##### All versions (Intel/Apple)
```console
$ make mac
```
NOTE: Sometimes Apple silicon version compiled on Intel machine does not work.

##### Intel x64
```console
$ make mac_intel
```

##### Apple Silicon (Apple M1 and above)
```console
$ make mac_apple
```

#### Linux x86-64 version

```console
$ make linux
```

### Packaging as zip files

Note: Packaging usually performs right after app building. Therefore you do not need this option in normal condition.

Note: Packaging macOS disk image requires electron-installer-dmg to make macOS disk image. It requires Python 2+ to build binary for package.

### Manual run to test Electron

Note: There are two Electron configuration files, `main.js` and `main.electron-packager.js`. Local Electron run uses `main.js`, not `main.electron-packager.js` that is used for real Electron app.

```console
$ make dep            # Compile with app dependencies
$ npm run electron:d  # OR, ./node_modules/electron/cli.js .
```

The electron app reads the configuration from `./build/electron-app/app/config.toml`, which is copied from the root `config.toml` file during `make clean && make dep`.

If you configure `[server].webServerURL`, the electron app will load the web contents (including `config.toml`) from the designated server.
The server may be either a `npm run server:d` instance or a `./py -m ai.backend.web.server` daemon from the mono-repo.
This is known as the "web shell" mode and allows live edits of the web UI while running it inside the electron app.

### Localization
Locale resources are JSON files located in `resources/i18n`.

Currently WebUI supports these languages:
 * English
 * Korean
 * French
 * Russian
 * Mongolian
 * Indonesian

#### Extracting i18n resources

Run
```console
$ make i18n
```
to update / extract i18n resources.

### Adding i18n strings

 * Use `_t` as i18n resource handler on lit-element templates.
 * Use `_tr` as i18n resource handler if i18n resource has HTML code inside.
 * Use `_text` as i18n resource handler on lit-element Javascript code.

#### Example

In lit-html template:
```html
<div>${_t('general.helloworld')}</div>
```

In i18n resource (en.json):
```json
{
   "general":{
      "helloworld": "Hello World"
   }
}
```
#### Adding new language

 1. Copy `en.json` to target language. (e.g. `ko.json`)
 2. Add language identifier to `supportLanguageCodes` in `backend-ai-webui.ts`.
e.g.
```javascript
  @property({type: Array}) supportLanguageCodes = ["en", "ko"];
```
 3. Add language information to `supportLanguages` in `backend-ai-usersettings-general-list.ts`.

Note: DO NOT DELETE 'default' language. It is used for browser language.

```javascript
  @property({type: Array}) supportLanguages = [
    {name: _text("language.Browser"), code: "default"},
    {name: _text("language.English"), code: "en"},
    {name: _text("language.Korean"), code: "ko"}
  ];
```
