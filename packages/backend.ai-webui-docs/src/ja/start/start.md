# Start Page

On the Start page, ユーザーs can quickly access frequently used WebUI features.
Currently, shortcuts are available for [creating storage folders](../vfolder/vfolder.md#create-storage-folder), [launching interactive or batch session](../sessions_all/sessions_all.md#create_session),
and [creating model service](../model_serving/model_serving.md). The position can be adjusted using the button at the top-left corner of each card.
