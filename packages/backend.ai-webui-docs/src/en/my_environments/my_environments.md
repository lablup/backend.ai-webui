# My Environments

From 24.03, a new \"My Environments\" page for users has been introduced.
This page displays contents such as a list of images created by the user's
[session commits](#save-session-commit).

On the Images tab of the My Environments page, users can manage customized
images used in creating compute sessions. This tab displays metadata information
of images converted from computational sessions to images. User can view details
such as the registry, architecture, namespace, language, version, base,
constraint, digest, and other information for each image.

To delete an image, click on the red trash button in the control column.
After deletion, you will not be able to create a new session using that image.

Click 'Copy' button in the control column, and go to sessions page and create a session.
Fill the input of manual image by pasting the image that you copied.
